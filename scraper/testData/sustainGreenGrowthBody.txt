To the Editor:

Re “The Next Resource Shortage?,” by David S. Abraham (Op-Ed, Nov. 20), about the need “to realize the resource implications of our green ambitions and develop a resource plan with them in mind”:

Mr. Abraham does not mention the increasing global efforts to maximize the sustainable use of materials including rare earth metals to achieve economic growth without compromising human health and the environment upon which that growth depends.

I recently represented the United States in the formal kickoff in Berlin of the G-7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency among the Group of 7 industrialized countries, industry and the public sector. Our goal is to establish a network to manage materials throughout their life cycles to deliver environmental and climate protection, employment, social benefits and sustainable green growth.

Building on our efforts to advance a circular economy approach to address resource efficiencies, the United States is planning a workshop in the spring that will share best practices related to industrial supply chains, drawing examples within the automotive sector so that we may advance effective and efficient materials use and management strategies across their life cycle.

The recognition of the importance of resource efficiency to economic growth by world leaders, the pledge for greater international cooperation and the circular economy approach to sustainable materials management are already doing exactly what Mr. Abraham recommends.
